 - Citation of the article

    Alani, M.M. Big data in cybersecurity: a survey of applications and future trends. J Reliable Intell Environ 7, 85–114 (2021). https://doi.org/10.1007/s40860-020-00120-3

 - In two or three sentences, discuss the goals of this article.

The goals of this paper is to tell its reader the importance of cybersecurity. It does that by describing the issue at hand. Such as intrusion and anomaly detection, spamming and spoofing detection, malware and ransomware detection, code security, and cloud security. Most of these isseus are known, but not yet solved due to their nature. 

 - What is /are the general task(s) that all the methods address in the article?

 The paper accomplished its purpose by asking 2 main question. Those questions are "Which areas of cybersecurity are witnessing developments in employing big data?" and "Which areas of cybersecurity have high potential in employing big data and big data anayltics in the coming few years?".


 - What are some of the leading methods introduced and discussed in this paper?

 Some leading or new methods that the article introduced "big data processing" and through literature. By literature review, I am referring to the data that was used in this survey. The article went into detailed on how the data was collected. It includes Database Search, Title based Filtering, Full text based Filtering, Snowballing, Final list of Literature, and Categorization.  


 - What is the context of the discussion of these methods? For instance, are there demonstrations in light of some task that they address?

In terms of content, there were not that many. What I mean is that the article didn't do its own research, because most of the article followed a certain pattern. For instance, the article starts out by explaining what the key issue were, using definitions and real life events as references, that it sites some literature. There not that much of demonstration in this article. 


 - How can some of these methods be used in your own work? What purpose would the method serve in your work?


I think the research data method will be very usful because it will help me narrow down data I need in order to find good and concrete data.

The article “From feeling like rape to a minor inconvenience” is a paper that I would never think that I would read. The paper is about a survey done on 52 people who fell victim to hacking and malware attacks. The age of people done on these people varies from the age of 18 to 75. We can say that people of all age groups are present for this study. The result is interesting, to say the least. Keep in mind all these people are professionals, employees, and employers. Most of them have some degree of knowledge regarding malware and cyber attacks. The paper goes into further detail on how these people react to being attacked from the web. Some stated that it was nothing, others said that it was like being raped. The main point of this paper is to tell its readers that computer misconduct is not a small crime and should be taken seriously.

This article piqued my interest due to Russia being at war with Ukraine. I remember reading a news article about how a group of hackers brought down some of Russia's networks. I did some research and it brought me to this. An article called “A methodological review on attack and defense strategies in cyber-warfare”. The main idea is stated in the title, it is an article about how people can defend themselves in a world where cyber warfare is a thing. The article goes over in detail different types of warfare techniques. Such as attacks using BYOD, SCADA, smart devices, IoT, and  Mimicking attacks.
