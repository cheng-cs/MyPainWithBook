1) Knowledge gap

 - As you know, we as a CS community knows quite a lot about malware and viruses. But do we really? If we do why can't we put it stop to it? The answer to that is pretty simple and at the same time quite difficult to answer. One possible answer to that question is that people still fall for basic tricks. Such as phishing, clicking on links from unknown sources, and etc. Another answer to that question is that hackers exists. Hacker is a term to describe people who breaks into things that they have no businese in. Most known for hacking databases, and bringing down websites. Hackers are always looking for ways to break into systems. In order to combat this rise in cases, we need to improve and create new technologies.  

2) Does a gap exists?
 - A gap exists because we are still dealing with invisible viruses. Viruses that cannot be detected by modern means. Hackers are getting smarter, and better. Based on four different research articles and blogs, there is a gap that needs to be filled.

3) Research questions:

- Is it possible to create an virus that does not mess with cpu, gpu, memory, performance, and heating of the machine?

 As you may already know, malware will mess up your machine in some way. Some malware may mess with your files, and hold them hostage (ransomeware). Some could be harmless like adware. But most, if not all, mess with some aspect of your system. This question explores the possiblity, if there are no hints, what will we do?

 - If it is possible, how does it work? How does it spread amoung themselves?
 - what kind of characteristics does it have? 

 The next two questions are subquestions. 

 - How are modern system missing these invisible viruses?
 My forth question explores the idea of an `invisible` viruses. This question intrest me because we don't know much. As a programmer and a Computer Science person myself, I cannot tell if my system contains an invisible virus. How can you expect someone with no experiance to feel? 


4) research experiment ideas

In order to fill in the knowledge gap, I have to do some experiments. Experiment can be put into multiple different categories based on the difficulties. For instance experimenting with a invisible malware myself. I can first write an harmless malware that can spread within a control environment and record its actions. Another possible experiment could be to create an software that looks for invisible malware. It does that by looking at CPU temps and Clock cycles, and then quarantine files if it finds anything weird.
