Research intrest:
 - Cyber Security
    - Hacking 
    - Malware 
        - SQL Injection
        - Hacking Techniques
 - Joining the Dark Side
    - Conquer the whole Dark Web

Currently I have 1 main intrest and 4 sub intrest. I want to work in the Cyber Security field in the future so that explains why my main intrest is in Cyber Security. But the real reason is that when someone ask me "what I do for a living?" I can answer with "I prevent hackers from getting your internet browser history". That makes me sound cool. 

One of the most important skill that I need to have acquire is hacking. Why hacking? Becuase its cool to say that I am a hacker. But for real, hacking is a curcial skill that everyone in the Cyber Security should have. Because it gave us insights. So we can better defend ourselves from those cyber attacks. 

Malware is what brought me the most amount of interest if you talk about Computer Science and Cyber Security. Especially how a single virus (worm) can take over your whole machine and potentially lock you out. That idea fascinate me, and I want to do something similar in the future. 

If Hacking and Malware are sub intrest. Then SQL injection and Hacking Techniques are sub sub intrest. Like sub squared. In greater detail, SQL is just some lazy way of breaking into a Database. 

Of course, my greastest joy is to join the dark side. And conquer the dark web. But that will happen with time and it will happen one day.
