1. Hardware: What hardware equipment is necessary to run this project? Include computer specifications or access to a cloud service.

In order to complete this project, I would like to have a fresh system. If the system is completly offline the better. The reason is that I would love to do some experiments. But most importantly I want to contain it so I won't be kick out of campus. I would also like to have an extra hard drive to do some testing and experiment. Because I was thinking of writing a program that expands file size. But I don't know if that kind of virus is already been discovered or labeled. But I think that will be a good starting point. I would also like to have access to anti malware software (norton or avast) to see if they can detect the virus I wrote. 

In terms of hardware specifications, nothing too serious is needed. So a basic labtop or desktop will work. I would like to work with a desktop if possible, but if I was given a laptop, tnen too bad. 

Skills: How do the skills that you possess contribute to the completion of your proposed project? Discuss your knowledge of programming languages you might use, familiarity with libraries, ability to install software, your proven record of learning new technical skills, etc.

I think I can develop my own website. That will solve that issue. The website is only for testing purposes, so nothing to fancy. This will take me about 2 - 3 hours tops. Another skill that I need to improve is probally coding. I need a refresher becuase its been a while since the last time I programmed. 

In terms of writing the malware, I want to hold on to it becuase I don't want to break my system. I would also need communication skills, so I can ask and recieve help from professors if I need any. 

Overall I think the project that I have mind is doable. But it may not be enough. I would like to see the amount of work that is required in writing the malware. If I have more then enough time, I will also make a malware detection system that covers this malware. Since this will be an invisible malware, it will be quite intresting to see how the detection system detect invisible malware.

Results: What do successful results look like? How will you test your project for both correctness and efficiency?

A sucessful result will be the virus be undetectable. For both human and machine. So that means that the person who was infected won't know (due to no system lag, etc) and anti malware failed in stopping it. 

Addtionally if I have time, (probally not) I would like to write a software that conters this virus (if the anti malware software missed it).

I think this will be a good starting ground and further ideas need time to develop.
