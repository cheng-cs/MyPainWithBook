Hello, my name is Gary, I am a computer science student at Allegheny College. Currently I am a Junior who specialize in both Computer science and Econ. I normally spend my time at my work place, people said that I have no life, which is quite true. I work from 11 am to 9 pm almost everyday. Yes I don't have a life.
